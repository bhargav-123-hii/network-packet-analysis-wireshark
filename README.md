# Network Packet Analysis using Wireshark

## 🛡 Overview
This project demonstrates network packet capture and analysis using Wireshark. It focuses on understanding how protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TCP work, and how data flows through the network.

## 📚 Objectives
- Analyze real-time network traffic using Wireshark.
- Identify vulnerabilities such as plaintext credentials.
- Understand common protocols: TCP, HTTP, DNS.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Windows 10 (or Linux)
- TCP/IP networking knowledge

## 📸 Screenshots
Captured during live sessions and saved in the /screenshots folder.

## 📁 Files
- .pcapng packet capture in /captures/
- Summary report in /docs/report.md

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Protocol behavior and filtering in Wireshark.
- Visualizing network attacks or weak security (e.g., unencrypted traffic).
- Hands-on skill in cybersecurity monitoring.
